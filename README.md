‚òÄÔ∏è Modern Weather App
This is a sleek and responsive web-based weather application built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to quickly check real-time weather conditions for any city worldwide, providing essential information like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a descriptive weather summary. The design is clean, intuitive, and adapts beautifully to various screen sizes.

‚ú® Features
Real-time Weather Data: Fetches and displays current weather conditions for any specified city.

Key Metrics: Shows temperature (¬∞C), "feels like" temperature (¬∞C), humidity (%), and wind speed (KPH).

Weather Description: Provides a concise description of current conditions (e.g., "Clear Sky," "Partly Cloudy," "Light Rain").

Dynamic Backgrounds/Icons: Visually represents weather conditions with appropriate icons or background changes.

Responsive Design: Optimized for seamless viewing and interaction across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

User-Friendly Interface: Clean layout and intuitive search functionality.

üíª Technologies Used
HTML5: For the core structure and content of the web page.

CSS3: For styling, layout (Flexbox/Grid), and responsive design.

JavaScript : For fetching data from the weather API, dynamic content updates, and user interaction.

Weather API: (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI.com, AccuWeather) - You will need to specify which API you used and link to it.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).

A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code).

An API key from your chosen weather service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI.com). You will need to sign up for an account and obtain a free API key.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/modern-weather-app.git

(Replace <your-username> with your actual GitHub username and modern-weather-app with your repo name).

Navigate to the project directory:

cd modern-weather-app

Open index.html:
Simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You can usually do this by double-clicking the file or by right-clicking and selecting "Open with" -> your preferred browser.

API Key Configuration
Open the script.js (or your main JavaScript file) in your text editor.

Locate the section where the API key is used (it's usually a constant or variable at the top of the file).

Replace the placeholder YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with your actual API key obtained from the weather service.

// Example in script.js
const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"; // <--- Replace this with your actual key
const BASE_URL = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"; // Example for OpenWeatherMap

Remember not to commit your actual API key directly to a public repository! For production, you'd typically use server-side environment variables, but for a simple client-side app, this direct insertion is common for demonstration purposes.

üí° How to Use
Open the index.html file in your web browser.

Type the name of a city into the search bar.

Press Enter or click the search button to get the real-time weather information.

üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements
5-Day / Hourly Forecast: Extend the app to show upcoming weather predictions.

Location Detection: Automatically detect the user's current location using Geolocation API.

Unit Conversion: Add a toggle for Celsius/Fahrenheit or KPH/MPH.

Error Handling: More robust error messages for invalid city names or API issues.

Loading States: Implement loading indicators while fetching data.

Dark Mode: Provide a dark theme option for better user experience.
