üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Weather App on your local machine.

Prerequisites
A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code).
An OpenWeatherMap API Key: You'll need to sign up for a free account and obtain an API key.

Installation

Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/weather-discord-bot.git
(Remember to replace <your-username> with your actual GitHub username and weather-discord-bot with your chosen repository name.)

Navigate to the project directory:

Bash
cd weather-discord-bot
API Key Configuration
Open the script.js file in your text editor.
Locate the line defining apiKey:
JavaScript

const apiKey = '123456789'; // Paste here your API key
Replace '123456789' with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key. Security Note: For client-side applications, API keys are exposed. For production environments, consider using a backend proxy to protect your key. For this demo, direct insertion is common practice.

Running the Application

Simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You can typically do this by double-clicking the file in your file explorer.
The application will load, displaying the "Search City" message.

üí° How to Use

Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Type the name of any city into the "Search City" input bar.
Press Enter or click the search icon button.
The app will display the current weather conditions and a 4-day forecast for the entered city. If the city is not found, an appropriate message will appear.
